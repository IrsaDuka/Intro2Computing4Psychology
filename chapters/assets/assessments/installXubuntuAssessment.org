#+TITLE: Install Ubuntu - Assessment

* Task
  
  Demonstrate that you have installed Ubuntu to your computer. If you are one of my uwaterloo students you will do this by uploading a screen shot of your Ubuntu desktop to the Learn Dropbox. Have something open where you can type in your name and student id so that I can verify who is who. 

* Comments
  
  There are [[https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux][screen capture tools]] available for your Ubuntu installation.
