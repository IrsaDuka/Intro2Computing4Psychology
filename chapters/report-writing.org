# * Report Writing
#   To be able to produce a reproducible research report you need to be able to write and blend code, text, analysis, graphics, and references. In this topic we will use Emacs, orgmode, and Babel with help from LaTeX and R to demonstrate the use of all these features
# ** Org, markdown, and related dialects and tools
# ** LaTeX
# ** Reference Management
# *** Biblatex (Bibtex)
# ** Mixing Code and Text
